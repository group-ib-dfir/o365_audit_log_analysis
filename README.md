# Office365 (Microsoft365) audit log analysis tool

The header describes it all

## WHY??
The first line of code was written long time before other colleagues contributed and shared their scripts. Always easier to modify own scripts than dig into someone's code

## Code Quality
Sorry PEPs, not in this life, it works

## HOW DOES IT WORK?
Hopefully, well

## Usage
Get o365_test.py, call any funciton you like, print any data you want from the structure, or create something on your own

## Acknowledgements
Huge thanks to python basic guides on structures
